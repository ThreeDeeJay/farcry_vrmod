Hello everyone,

Far Cry VR v0.5 is now available. This is the first release featuring motion controls, and while
there's room for improvement and polish, the game should be fully playable with motion controllers.

Download the release here: [Far Cry VR v0.5 on GitHub](https://github.com/fholger/farcry_vrmod/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

Have fun!
