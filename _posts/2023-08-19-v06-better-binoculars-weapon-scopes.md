Hello everyone,

Far Cry VR v0.6 is now available. This release features a number of bug fixes and overhauls the way the binoculars
and weapon scopes work: the game will still switch to a 2D rendering mode, but instead of having the 2D view be at
a fixed distance in front of your head, it will now follow your off hand controller for a more natural handling.

Download the release here: [Far Cry VR v0.6 on GitHub](https://github.com/fholger/farcry_vrmod/releases/tag/v0.6.0)

Have fun!
