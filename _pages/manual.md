## Installation

Run the installer. It is not signed, so you may get a warning from Windows and will have to tell it to run it, anyway.
Make sure it points to your Far Cry installation folder - it should auto-detect the right folder for gog, Steam and Ubisoft versions.

## Running the mod

Start SteamVR. Make sure your headset is working properly. Then launch FarCryVR.exe from the game's install folder - if you did not deselect it during installation, you should also have desktop and/or start menu shortcuts to the Far Cry VR mod that you can launch.

## Configuration

Use your motion controllers to navigate the game menu. You may have to tap the trigger on your controller to get it to control the mouse cursor.
Head into the Options and configure the game to your liking. I recommend pushing the graphics options to the max, or close to it - the game is not very demanding on your GPU. For sound, make sure that you select "headphones" and enable hardware acceleration and EAX.

On the "VR options" tab, you will find VR-specific options where you can select your dominant hand (the hand that will be holding the weapons), turn mode, movement direction and a couple more options you can experiment with.
It is recommended to enable the options to force higher detail in the game and to max out the vegetation distance slider for the best visual experience.

## Controls

Controls can be customized through the SteamVR controller bindings. The mod includes default bindings for Index and Oculus Touch controllers in two variations. The variations differ in the controls for vehicles - the default has vehicle steering and throttle on the left stick while keeping the remaining controls close to the on foot controls. The alternative preset puts vehicle throttle on the triggers for a better steering experience, but as a consequence needs to shuffle around the remaining controls (see below).

Other controllers which are Touch-like (including Reverb G2 and Pico) should work out of the box with the Touch profile. Other controllers like the Vive wands might need you to set up custom bindings.

The sections below will show and explain the default bindings for a right-handed player. If you are left-handed, go into the options and under "VR Options" switch your dominant hand. This will swap all controls between the left and right controller - if you don't want to swap certain bindings (e.g. the stick functions), you will have to set up a custom controller binding.
