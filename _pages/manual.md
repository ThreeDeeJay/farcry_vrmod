## Calibrating your view

Important: you need to recenter your view in SteamVR once you have assumed your seated or standing position. To do so, bring up the SteamVR dashboard and hit the "Recenter view" icon. The game will place the player's head at the calibrated height; your floor level may not necessarily match the ingame floor height.

## Controls

Controls can be customized through the SteamVR controller bindings. The mod includes default bindings for Index and Oculus Touch controllers. Other controllers which are Touch-like (including Reverb G2 and Pico) should work out of the box with the Touch profile. Other controllers might need custom bindings.

The sections below will show and explain the default bindings for a right-handed player. If you are left-handed, go into the options and under "VR Options" switch your dominant hand. This will swap all controls between the left and right controller - if you don't want to swap certain bindings (e.g. the stick functions), you will have to set up a custom controller binding.

### On foot

Use the left stick to move around or click it to activate sprint. Sprint will remain active until you release the stick back to neutral. You can also physically walk around.

The right stick allows you to turn the camera; you can choose between smooth and snap turn in the options. By moving the right stick down you can toggle between the crouch and prone poses. There is currently no support for physically crouching. Moving the right stick up will make you stand up again or jump if you were already standing.

Press the off-hand trigger to use items in the game. If you bring your hand close to your head, trigger will instead toggle your flashlight on a short press or the CryVision on a long press.

Press the left A/X button to activate your binoculars. The binoculars will be displayed in a 2D overlay anchored to your off hand. Use your right stick up/down to zoom in or out in the binoculars. Press the left A/X button again to put the binoculars away.

Weapons are controlled by your dominant hand (as chosen in the options). Press trigger on your main controller to fire the weapon and A/X to reload. Hold the A/X button to switch between the available fire modes for the current weapon. Cycle to the next weapon by pressing the joystick/trackpad. Hold the joystick/trackpad to drop your current weapon. Press the B/Y button to cycle between your available grenade types or rocks. Hold the B/Y button to throw the currently selected grenade type.

Most weapons can be held with both hands. Bring your off-hand controller towards where the second hand should go on the weapon and hold the grip button. Two-handing guns will stabilize them and reduce recoil, as will crouching or lying down.

If the current weapon has a scope, you can activate it by grabbing it with both hands and then bringing your main hand close to your head. The scope will be shown as a 2D overlay where you can aim and zoom the weapon. Use your main hand's stick up/down to zoom in or out with the scope.

### Vehicles

Press your off-hand trigger to enter a vehicle. Press your off-hand A/X button to leave the vehicle.

While in the vehicle, the right trigger is used to accelerate, while the left trigger will brake/reverse. The left stick is used to steer the vehicle, while the right stick can be used to rotate the view. If you prefer to have all vehicle movement on the stick, you can unbind the accelerate and brake actions in the SteamVR controller bindings. The stick will then also control the vehicle's throttle.

Point with your main hand to aim the vehicle weapon and press the A/X button to fire it.

Pressing the left stick/trackpad will switch between first and third person view. The right stick toggles the vehicle's lights. The right B button swaps seats.
