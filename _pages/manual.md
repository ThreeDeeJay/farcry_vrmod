## Installation

Run the installer. It is not signed, so you may get a warning from Windows and will have to tell it to run it, anyway.
Make sure it points to your Far Cry installation folder - it should auto-detect the right folder for gog, Steam and Ubisoft versions.

## Running the mod

Start SteamVR. Make sure your headset is working properly. Then launch FarCryVR.exe from the game's install folder - if you did not deselect it during installation, you should also have desktop and/or start menu shortcuts to the Far Cry VR mod that you can launch.

## Configuration

Use your motion controllers to navigate the game menu. You may have to tap the trigger on your controller to get it to control the mouse cursor.
Head into the Options and configure the game to your liking. You can probably push the graphics options to the max, or close to it. For sound, make sure that you select "headphones".

On the "VR options" tab, you will find VR-specific options where you can select your dominant hand (the hand that will be holding the weapons), turn mode, movement direction and a couple more options you can experiment with.

## Controls

Controls can be customized through the SteamVR controller bindings. The mod includes default bindings for Index and Oculus Touch controllers. Other controllers which are Touch-like (including Reverb G2 and Pico) should work out of the box with the Touch profile. Other controllers like the Vive wands might need you to set up custom bindings.

The sections below will show and explain the default bindings for a right-handed player. If you are left-handed, go into the options and under "VR Options" switch your dominant hand. This will swap all controls between the left and right controller - if you don't want to swap certain bindings (e.g. the stick functions), you will have to set up a custom controller binding.
